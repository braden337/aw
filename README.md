Make sure you have Ruby installed, and run `gem install bundler`. You will then
be able to run `bundle install`. That will install all the gems you need. When
that finishes you can run `compass watch` to continuously compile the sass file
into css.

Open up another tab in your terminal and if you have Python you can run
`python3 -m http.server 8000` to start a web server in this folder. The site
should be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
